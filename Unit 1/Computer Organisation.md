### Basic organisation of computers

Computer organization refers to the way a computer's hardware components are structured and interconnected to perform various tasks efficiently. It encompasses the design and arrangement of a computer's central processing unit (CPU), memory, input/output devices, and other essential components. Here is a basic overview of the organization of a computer:

1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU)**:
   - The CPU is the brain of the computer and executes instructions stored in memory.
   - It consists of two main units: the Control Unit (CU) and the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU).
   - The CU fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and controls the execution of the program.
   - The ALU performs arithmetic and logic operations.

2. **Memory**:
   - Memory is used for storing data and instructions that the CPU accesses during processing.
   - The primary types of memory are:
     - **RAM (Random Access Memory)**: Volatile memory used for temporarily storing data and program instructions that are actively being used.
     - **ROM (Read-Only Memory)**: Non-volatile memory that contains firmware and instructions that are permanently stored and cannot be altered by the user.
     - **Cache**: High-speed memory located close to the CPU that stores frequently used data to speed up processing.

3. **Input/Output (I/O) Devices**:
   - These devices allow the computer to interact with the external world.
   - Common input devices include keyboards, mice, and sensors.
   - Common output devices include monitors, printers, and speakers.

4. **System Bus**:
   - The system bus is a communication pathway that connects the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
   - It consists of three main buses: the data bus, address bus, and control bus.
   - The data bus transfers data between the CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
   - The address bus specifies the location of data in memory.
   - The control bus carries control signals for coordinating data transfer and operations.

5. **Storage Devices**:
   - These devices are used for long-term data storage.
   - Common storage devices include hard drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and optical drives (e.g., DVD-ROM).

6. **Motherboard**:
   - The motherboard is the main circuit board that houses the CPU, memory, and other essential components.
   - It provides connections for power, data transfer, and expansion cards.

7. **Expansion Slots and Cards**:
   - Expansion slots allow for the addition of specialized hardware, such as graphics cards, sound cards, and network cards.

8. **Power Supply Unit (PSU)**:
   - The PSU provides electrical power to all components within the computer.

9. **Operating System (OS)**:
   - The OS manages hardware resources and provides a user interface for running applications.
   - It facilitates communication between software and hardware components.

10. **Software**:
    - Software includes both system software (e.g., operating systems) and application software (e.g., word processors, web browsers) that run on the computer.

Computer organization principles are essential for computer architects and engineers to design efficient and effective computer systems. Understanding these basic components and their interactions is fundamental to computer science and engineering.

### Micro Computer 

A microcomputer, often simply referred to as a "micro," is a type of small-scale computer that typically consists of a single microprocessor chip (CPU), memory, input/output (I/O) interfaces, and storage. These computers are designed for individual use and are much smaller and less powerful than mainframe and minicomputers. Microcomputers are what most people think of when they hear the term "computer" because they are commonly used for personal and business purposes. Here are some key characteristics and examples of microcomputers:

1. **Size:** Microcomputers are small and compact, making them suitable for desktop or portable use. They can easily fit on a desk or be carried around.

2. **Processor:** They use microprocessors as their central processing unit (CPU), which is responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations. Examples of microprocessors include those made by Intel, AMD, and ARM.

3. **Memory:** Microcomputers have both volatile memory (RAM) for temporary data storage and non-volatile memory (storage devices like hard drives or SSDs) for long-term data storage.

4. **Operating System:** They typically run operating systems like Windows, macOS, Linux, or mobile operating systems (e.g., Android or iOS), which provide a user-friendly interface for running software applications.

5. **Applications:** Microcomputers are used for a wide range of applications, including word processing, web browsing, gaming, multimedia, programming, and more. They can be customized with software to suit various needs.

6. **Examples:** Some common examples of microcomputers include:
   - **Desktop Computers:** Traditional personal computers that sit on a desk and are commonly used in homes and offices.
   - **Laptop Computers:** Portable computers with a built-in screen, keyboard, and touchpad or pointing device.
   - **Tablets:** Compact, touchscreen-based devices that are often used for browsing, media consumption, and mobile apps.
   - **Smartphones:** Highly portable, pocket-sized devices that combine phone, computer, and communication functions.

7. **Connectivity:** Microcomputers are equipped with various ports and wireless capabilities for connecting to the internet, external devices (e.g., printers, monitors), and networks.

8. **User Interface:** They provide user-friendly interfaces for interaction, such as graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with icons, windows, and menus.

Microcomputers are versatile and widely used for everyday computing tasks, ranging from word processing and email to web browsing and entertainment. They have become an integral part of modern life, serving as personal productivity tools, communication devices, and entertainment hubs.
